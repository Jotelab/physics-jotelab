-- Canonical definition, reconstructed from the migration history by
-- `pnpm run db:functions:sync`. Migrations remain the source of truth for the
-- database; this file is the source of truth for *review* — it is what lets you
-- diff two versions of a function instead of two 300-line migration pastes.
--
-- To change this function: write a migration containing the new definition,
-- then re-run the sync. `pnpm run db:functions:check` fails if the two drift.
